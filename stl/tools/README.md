Drilling jigs.

J1 lets you space the gantry holes down from the top. J2-J4 let you space the two sets of lower extrusions from one another correctly, and include progressively larger holes for access to stepper motors. I used all of them, in sequence, to make holes large enough to fully insert and remove SHS screws from my front NEMA17 Z motors.

I used an existing 200mm extrusion (with the 7.5mm holes) to space the upper bed mount strut from the deck.

Verticals need to be drilled all round with 7.5mm holes at the ends.

J1 is used to drill gantry mounting holes facing inwards towards the long edge of the printer.

J2 is used to drill the 70mm holes all round.

J2 through J4 are then used on the front verticals, to drill motor access holes facing forwards. Be careful, these are outset slightly from centre.

Finally, a 200mm extrusion with 7.5mm holes at each end is used on the rear verticals to drill the holes for the upper bed mount strut, facing inwards towards the long edge of the printer.

We're probably going to need to drill some holes in the 300mm struts for the gantry too, but didn't get there yet :-)
